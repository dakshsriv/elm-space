# My Elm code

This uses images from https://solarsystemscope.com.

You can head over to their website to check out their solar system resources such as the explorer, images, and more.

This also uses an image from p0 on https://pikist.com as the background.

This game is for my summer camp course.
It is coded in the Elm language on the website https://macoutreach.rocks.
